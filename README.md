# What is this?
This is a basic implementation of what will be game of life. 

#Prerequisites
* numpy-1.19.0
* pygame-2.0.0.dev6

#Instructions
* s to toggle drawing
* t to cycle one iteration (not yet completed)
* a to toggle automatic

#ToDos
* Currently the playing field wraps around (i.e neigbours are counted also wrapped around the field) - fix.
* Performance is abysmal - need to optimize to not scan through all items etc...
